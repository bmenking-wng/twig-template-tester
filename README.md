This reallyyyy needs to be documented.  

-- Setup --

Drop a twig (or twigs) into templates/ directory.
Add a params file in params/ with the same name as the twig template name.

-- Running --

Easiest way is to use `php -S localhost:7777` and open a browser, type in

`http://localhost:7777/render.php?template=<template name>`
